# What it tests

Tests for a pipeline with splits.  It consists of a single stage, SUM_SQUARES,
which splits, computes the square of each argument in the input list in a
separate chunk, and then sums the chunk outputs in a join phase.

split_test.json tests normal operation

# How to test

1. Compile the example 
```
cargo b --release --example sum_sq
```

2. Copy `target/release/examples/sum_sq` binary to somewhere in your `$PATH` or add that directory to PATH

3. Make sure `mrp` is in your path

4. Run the test
```
../martian_test.py split_test.json
```
